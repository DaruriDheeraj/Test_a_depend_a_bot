grep: ./scan_output.txt: input file is also the output
Error: Process completed with exit code 2.

The error occurs because you are scanning all files (including scan_output.txt) while also writing results to scan_output.txt, causing grep to read its own output and create a loop.
Fix: Exclude scan_output.txt

Modify the grep command to ignore the scan_output.txt file:

      - name: Search for sensitive data patterns
        run: |
          echo "Scanning for potential sensitive data..." > scan_results.txt
          grep -r -E "AWS_ACCESS_KEY|SECRET_KEY|API_KEY|PASSWORD|TOKEN" . --exclude="scan_output.txt" > scan_output.txt || true
          cat scan_output.txt >> scan_results.txt

Explanation of Fix

    --exclude="scan_output.txt" â†’ This prevents grep from scanning its own output file.
    || true â†’ Ensures that grep does not fail the workflow if no sensitive data is found (because grep returns a nonzero exit code when thereâ€™s no match).

Try this fix and let me know if you need further modifications! ðŸš€

How to show the artifacts in the below code
ChatGPT said:

To show the artifacts in your GitHub Actions workflow, you need to download and view the uploaded artifact (scan-results). Here's how you can do it:
Modify Your Workflow to Include Artifact Download

Add a new job or step to download and display the artifact:

name: Scan for Sensitive Data

on:
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allows manual trigger
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  secrets-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Search for sensitive data patterns
        run: |
          echo "Scanning for potential sensitive data..." > scan_results.txt
          grep -r -E "AWS_ACCESS_KEY|SECRET_KEY|API_KEY|PASSWORD|TOKEN" . --exclude="scan_output.txt" > scan_output.txt || true
          cat scan_output.txt >> scan_results.txt

      - name: Upload scan results
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: scan-results
          path: scan_results.txt
          
  display-results:
    needs: secrets-scan  # Ensure this job runs after secrets-scan
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Download scan results
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: scan-results

      - name: Display scan results
        run: cat scan_results.txt
